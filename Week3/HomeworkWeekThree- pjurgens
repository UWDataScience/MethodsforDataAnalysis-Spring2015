# How might the use of this data set bias the result from the last question?

# This data set only includes women who have had at least 2 children. 
# The birth of the second child from the same mother could be affected by the pregnancy length of the first child, 
# and thus our data set is biased.

# Suppose that you now learn that the baby in question is a second child. 
# Now what is the probability of our baby being born 24 or more days early?

# follow the same distribution as the length for the second child?

qqplot(birth.data$First, birth.data$Second)
abline(0,1,col="red")

# Yes, the distributions are fairly similar

# Is the length of a pregnancy for a first child independent of the length for the second child?

t.test(birth.data$First, birth.data$Second)

# Null hypothesis: The length of a pregnancy for a first child is independent of the length for the second child
# Alternative hypothesis: The length of a pregnancy for a first child is not independent of the length for the second child
# The results of the t-test give a p-value of .3033, and we reject the null hypothesis.
# Thus, the length of a pregnancy for a first child is not independent of the length for the second child.
