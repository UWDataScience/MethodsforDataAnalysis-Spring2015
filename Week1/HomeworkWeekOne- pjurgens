# 1dii) Use the command “sapply” to apply a function to each value in “ua”. The function should return the mean whole weight of all abalone of a given age.

# 1diii) Use the “plot” command to plot mean weight vs. age. Similarly to our previous table of age and height, the older the abalone, the heavier, until they reach
# maturity at about 13, at which point the weight evens out a bit. As the abalone get towards the end of their average life span, the population is going to go down, 
# which will skew results and may explain the variance within the 25+ age range
