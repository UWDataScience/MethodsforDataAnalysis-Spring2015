# Are rider category and day of week independent?

# Null Hypothesis: The rider category and the day of week are independent.
# Alternative Hypothesis: The rider category and the day of week are not independent.
chisq.test(bikeTable)

# Our p-value is very small and far below our significance level for testing, thus we reject the null hypothesis.
# This suggests there is a dependence between the rider category and the day of the week.

# 3) Consider the distribution of registered user rides for each day of the week. 
# Is it the same as the distribution of casual user rides for each day of the week?

# Null Hypothesis: The distribution of casual riders and registered riders for each day of the week is the same
# Alternative Hypothesis: The distribution of casual riders and registered riders for each day of the week is not the same

ks.test(casualRow, registeredRow)

# Our p-value is 0.01168, thus we can reject the null hypothesis and the distribution of casual riders and 
# registered riders for each day of the week is not the same

# 4) On average, do more people ride on the weekends or on weekdays?

weekTable = rbind(weekdayRiders, weekendRiders)

# Null Hypothesis: The difference in means between weekend and weekday riders is zero.
# Alternative Hypothesis: The difference in means between weekend and weekday riders is greater than zero.

t.test(weekdayRiders, weekendRiders, alternative = "greater")

# Our p-value is 0.1318, thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis. I think something is wrong here, but I'm not sure what.

# 5) Is it reasonable to apply a t-test in answering question 4?
# Yes. The t-test compares the means of distributions, which is what we are being asked to do in this question.
